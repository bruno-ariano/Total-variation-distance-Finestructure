# Total-variation-distance-Finestructure

Following S. Leslie et al. 2015 method, I have made a simple script to calculate the total variation distance using fineSTRUCTURE and Chromopainter(Lawson et al. 2012) results.

This script works with the libraries for the fineSTRUCTURE plot that can be taken from: https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~madjl/finestructure/finestructureR.html
